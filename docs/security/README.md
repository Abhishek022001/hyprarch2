## Security
This is where the documentation for `hyprarch2` security and privacy lives. 
- Some security appliances for this repo are stored in a dedicated repo such as [sysctl](https://github.com/g5ostXa/sysctl). However, they get downloaded and configured automatically when installing `hyprarch2`.
