### Setup wallpaper 
> [!NOTE]
> - On the first boot, the wallpaper might not load by default. `waybar` might not launch either. To fix this, simply run `waypaper` from the terminal and select a wallpaper.
> - If `waybar` still doesn't launch after setting the wallpaper, simply reload waybar.

### Install wallpaper
- If you have installed [hyprarch2](https://github.com/g5ostXa/hyprarch2), the wallpaper repo was automatically installed with the install script. Otherwise, run the following to install manually:
```
$ cd ~/Downloads
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/g5ostXa/wallpaper.git
```
